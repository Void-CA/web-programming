                The CS50 course has been a great help to me, it was a great surprise to see through the lectures,
                sections and shorts how it can be taught online in an extremely effective and concise way,
                I love how each part of the teaching teaches you It makes everything learned clear,
                each part of the weeks is covered from the most general to the most specific,
                ending with the practical exercises. 
                I think it has worked a lot for me, and I like this way of teaching.

                How CS50 have helped me
            </h2>
            <p class="texto-me">
                CS50 is an extra to my engineering studies, many of the weeks of the course have helped me 
                a lot to understand many classes of my degree, which are very related, the use of various 
                languages, web programming, databases, data structures ,
                all of this is much easier for me once I finish the CS50.

                These are some of the weeks in which the course has helped me the most:

                        The first week, despite being mostly introductory and simple, the first problem set is very entertaining to do,
                         I personally made a Pacman, but despite being something very calm,
                          it is something that helped me understand the concepts of functions, conditionals and loops,
                         having a more visible way of understanding it.

                        Weeks 4 and 5 were of great help to me in understanding a class called "Operating Systems"
                        which I was taking at the same time as the aforementioned weeks,
                         through this I was able to understand how memory distributions work, 
                         and above all the use of pointers in data structures, 
                         which was a topic with which I was still confused,
                        I managed to clarify myself and be able to use them freely

                        The use of python was a very pleasant change, given that I had come from programming only with the C language, 
                        it was a simple and particularly satisfactory week, where solving the same problems that were previously complicated was pleasant, 
                        I also consider it was a first step towards a future where I will use this language a lot, 
                        and I consider this week to have been a solid foundation for my future as a professional.

                        I consider this to be one of the most important weeks, 
                        and also my favorite, not only because I have my favorite problem set so far, 
                        but also because SQL turns out to be a fundamental tool in many of the approaches to computer science, 
                        and personally a very important part of what I would like to dedicate myself to in the future.

                        Week 8 has been quite entertaining, learning a completely new area such as web development has been very interesting, 
                        and I have gotten carried away with creativity creating problem set 8, 
                        it has also been very helpful to me with the classes of
                        my career, 
                        especially in something called "Web Programming", which is the same thing, and it is easier for me.

        My experience in CS50 has been very enriching, and I believe it has even helped me to know myself.
