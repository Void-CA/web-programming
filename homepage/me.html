                Biography
            </h1>
            <p class="texto-me">
                My full name is Ari Alejandro Castillo Amador. I was born and grew in Chinandega, Nicaragua, surrounded by my family's warmth 
                and the cultural wealth of my surroundings. From a young age, I discovered a fascination with technology,
                which eventually led me to choose Cybernetic Engineering as my academic path.

                Universidad Tecnologica de la Salle (ULSA)
            </h3>
            <p class="texto-me">
                In 2021 I graduated from the "Hogar Paulo VI" School, 
                where on the advice of a professor I entered the "Universidad Tecnologica de la Salle" on his recommendation. 
                At the beginning, although I was interested in technology, for personal reasons I preferred to enter studying
                 Industrial Engineering, but as time went by, meeting people, 
                 my time watching university projects and various classes related to it, 
                 I preferred to change to a career in Cybernetic Engineering, which I consider was a great decision on my part. 
                I am very happy to have taken it. Currently I'm at the 3rd year and I'm
                much more comfortable with what I am currently studying.

            <p class="texto-me">
                2 years ago I started learning English at the "" but due to my own lack of interest in the subject, 
                I decided to leave, at the beginning of the year 2023 I resumed my studies of the language again,
                 and currently I continue studying it,
                 CS50 has also been helpful to me to put it into practice.

                My own
            </h3>
            <p class="texto-me">
                I really like to learn and keep my mind busy whenever I can, so most of the time, 
                in parallel with my aforementioned studies, I looked for means to study topics of my interest,
                generally they are topics related to programming, 
                and in this same way that is how I ended up studying CS50

                Personal Interests
            </h2>
            <p class="texto-me text-centered">
                Exploring my personal interests is like opening the doors to a constantly evolving world. 
                Each interest is a pillar that shapes my identity.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Programming
            </h3>
            <p class="texto-me">
                It's probably no surprise that I mention this as one of my big personal interests,
                but I'd like to share how this came about. 
                During the time period in which I was still studying industrial engineering,
                my brother, who works with a bank, 
                showed me an area of cybersecurity development where,
                although it was not cybersecurity that caught me,
                I found it somewhat incredible how the logic was developed so that a computer could understand an order.
                That encouraged my interest in programming

                Music
            </h3>
            <p class="texto-me">
                I really like listening to music, it is always an accompaniment to my daily activities, 
                in fact while making this website, 
                I spent most of the time listening to music.
                My favorite musical genres are trap and reggaeton, although lately I have been listening to calm music to concentrate. 
                I have always liked livelier music, my favorite artist is Mora, who I probably listen to every day.
                 Her songs convey a very particular feeling to me, listening to her songs puts me in the mood,
                 and to this day I still regret not having gone to her concert on her tour of Nicaragua.

            <h3>
                Animals
            </h3>
            <p class="texto-me">
                As I mentioned previously, my family has dedicated itself to agriculture, 
                in this part of its life livestock has also been involved, and I have been in contact with animals all my life.
                I love animals, whenever I can I have tried to help stray animals since there is no organization here that takes care of it
                , throughout my life I have adopted many stray animals and I have wanted to give them a better life,
                many times I would like to adopt them all, but I don't have the possibilities to do so. If it is up to me in the future,
                I will try to take care of all the animals I can. There have been many little animals that have kept a space in my heart, 
                which I would like many people to be able to experience.

                For me, it is crucial to build a life where happiness is the main axis.
                I constantly seek that perfect balance between personal enjoyment and daily responsibilities.
                Dedicate what is necessary to aspects of your life. Love, family, your passions, in the root of this thinking,
                I am forging a trajectory that I really passionate. 
                I think that merging my passions with my daily duties allows me to face my responsibilities with a clear purpose.
                I like to think of life as a trip only, without regrets, 
                live the day by day with what you like to do, where every day seeks to be a better version of my
